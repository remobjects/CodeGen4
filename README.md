# CodeGen4

CodeGen4 is an open source cross-platform, language agnostic code generation engine that will
drive the future code generation in RemObjects products from RemObjects SDK and Data Abstract
to Elements, as well as secondary projects such as Marzipan, Oxidizer and others.

CodeGen4 is designed so that it can easily be expanded to cover additional target languages, with
the implementation of one class.

Currently in very early prototype stage, and not ready for consumption, just yet.
But feedback and contributions are welcome.

Implemented in Swift with [RemObjects Silver](http://elementscompiler.com/silver).

## Platform support:

CodeGen4 can be used *on* (i.e. linked into tools written for) the following platforms:

* .NET, Cocoa and Java, via the [Elements](http://elementscompiler.com) compiler
